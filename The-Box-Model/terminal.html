    <h3>Scotland forward and Girls United ambassador aims to highlight football’s physical and social benefits</h3>
    <span class="byline">WRITTEN BY: Suzanne Wrack</span>
    <p>Caroline Weir has tried to make the most of the enforced break. “A real positive of lockdown is that players have
      had
      time to reflect, take a minute and think about what’s important. It has for me anyway,” the Manchester City
      forward
      says.</p>

    <p>At 24, the Scotland international was playing some of her best football before the pandemic cut short the season.
      The
      focus of her career may have been on getting to the top but it had “always been in my head to give back. Now I
      feel I’m
      at the age where it is something I want to be more conscious of.”</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <h2>“It’s made me think that whatever I go into has to give me a similar buzz and be something I enjoy. There
        won’t be a
        game day one day, so there has to be something similar that I’m working towards. But hopefully I’ve got a few
        years
        yet.”</h2>
    </div>

    <p>It’s where kids fall in love with football and it’s such an important time. I still remember playing with the
      boys at
      five all the way through to age 10 and going down on a Saturday morning to these big grassy muddy fields.</p>

    <p>Helping more girls enjoy football prompted the link-up with Girls United. “Lots of girls, especially teenagers,
      drop out
      of the game. I want to help highlight the many positive physical and social reasons for girls to carry on
      playing.”</p>
