    <p>coronavirus (Covid-19 tracker): The number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 in India has crossed
      the 1.45
      lakh-mark, of which nearly 33,000 were reported in the last five days. India is now among the top 10 countries
      with the
      highest caseload. It has already emerged as the biggest epicenter of Covid-19 cases in Asia. For the past five
      days,
      more than 6,000 cases have been reported in India every day. On May 25, India saw its highest single-day spike
      with
      6,977 new cases being reported.</p>
    <p>Thirty-five of the country's 36 states and Union Territories have reported Covid-19 cases so far, with Sikkim
      being the
      latest to report a case. However, despite this, the central government continues to maintain that community
      transmission
      has yet not taken place in India. </p>
    <p>According to the latest data put out by the Union health ministry, as of 8 am on May 26, the number of Covid-19
      cases in
      India is 1,45,380, of which 60,491 have recovered and 4,167 have died so far. </p>
