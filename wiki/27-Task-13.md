1. In **stylesheet.css**, write a selector for `h5` elements. Inside of the curly braces write:
```css
color: rebeccapurple;
```

Notice that the `h5` elements in the descriptions will not change color. They will continue to be `teal`.

This is due to there being a more specific selector for `h5` elements that you wrote in the last exercise. Because of the more specific CSS selector (`.description h5`), the more general selector of `h5` will not take hold.
