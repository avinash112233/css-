1. In **index.html**, each poses has a description paragraph below it. Inside each description, there’s a list of procedure. Let’s select the `How to do it` element and make it stand out more by making it teal.

   Navigate to **stylesheet.css**. Add a selector that targets all of the `h5` elements nested inside elements with class `.description`.

2. Inside the curly braces of the selector, write:
```css
color: teal;
```
