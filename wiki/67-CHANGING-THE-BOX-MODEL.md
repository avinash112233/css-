## Why Change the Box Model?

The last lesson focused on the most important aspects of the box model: box dimensions, borders, padding, and margin.

The box model, however, has an awkward limitation regarding box dimensions. This limitation is best illustrated with an example.
```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

```css
h1 {
  border: 1px solid black;
  height: 200px;
  width: 300px;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

In the example above, a heading element’s box has solid, black, 1 pixel thick borders. The height of the box is 200 pixels, while the width of the box is 300 pixels. A padding of 10 pixels has also been set on all four sides of the box’s content.

Unfortunately, under the current box model, the border thickness and the padding will affect the dimensions of the box.

The 10 pixels of padding increases the height of the box to 220 pixels and the width to 320 pixels. Next, the 1-pixel thick border increases the height to 222 pixels and the width to 322 pixels.

Under this box model, the border thickness and padding are added to the overall dimensions of the box. This makes it difficult to accurately size a box in case of changes. Over time, this can also make all of a web page’s content difficult to position and manage.

In this brief lesson, you’ll learn how to use a different technique that avoids this problem altogether.
