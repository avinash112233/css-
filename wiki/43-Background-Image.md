CSS has the ability to change the background of an element. One option is to make the background of an element an image. This is done through the CSS property `background-image`. Its syntax looks like this:
```css
.main-banner {
  background-image: url("https://www.example.com/image.jpg");
}
```

1. The `background-image` property will set the elementâ€™s background to display an image.
2. The value provided to `background-image` is a url. The url should be a url to an image. The url can be a file within your project, or it can be a link to an external site. To link to an image inside an existing project, you must provide a relative file path. If there was an `images` folder in the project, with an image named `mountains.jpg`, the relative file path would look like:

```css
.main-banner {
  background-image: url("images/mountains.jpg");
}
```
