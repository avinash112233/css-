1. In **survey.css**, set the position inside of the `header` selector to `absolute`. Scroll up and down the web page. What do you notice?

2. When you changed the position to absolute, you may have noticed that the header shrunk horizontally. We’ll learn why in a later exercise. For now, set the `width` property of the header to `100%`.

3. Now change the position inside of the `header` rule to `fixed`. Scroll up and down the web page. What do you notice?

2. Notice that part of the “Welcome” section is now covered up by the header. That’s because when we changed the `position` of the header to `fixed`, we removed it from the flow of the html document. Let’s fix that. Change the `position` of the `.welcome` element to `relative`.

3. Offset the “Welcome” section by 200 pixels from the top. Everything might not be displaying correctly just yet; we’ll fix it in a later exercise.
