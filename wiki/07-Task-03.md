1. In the **CSS Setup and Selectors** directory, add a **stylesheet.css**.
2. Take a look at **index.html**. Cut the CSS code in between the opening and closing `<style>` tags and paste it directly in the new file called **stylesheet.css**.

   Make sure to delete the remaining `<style>` element (now empty) from **index.html**.

Don't worry if you can not find this style to be working. It will start working on the next task as there you will get to know about the linking of the external stylesheet to the HTML webpage.

`Your previous tests may got failed here because you have not linked your external stylesheet to your HTML webpage`. So proceed to the next task to link them.
