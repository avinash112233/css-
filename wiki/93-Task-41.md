Now switch to the **Coffee** directory in the current repository. From now, all the task will be executed in this directory

1. In **coffee.css**, set the foreground color of the `h1` heading to `MidnightBlue`.

2. Next, set the background color of the `h1` heading to `Aqua`.

   Notice that the `background-color` property did not change the background color of the entire page. Instead, only the background area behind heading changed. Weâ€™ll learn why this occurs in more detail later in the course.

Note: The background color of the heading will block the image of the coffee.
