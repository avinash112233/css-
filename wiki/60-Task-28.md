1. In **terminal.css**, set the minimum width of the paragraph to 200 pixels.

   After you’ve done this successfully, resize the browser and notice how the paragraph’s box will no longer shrink below 200 pixels.


2. Next, set the maximum width of the paragraph to 800 pixels.

   After you’ve done this successfully, resize the browser and notice how the paragraph’s box will no longer expand beyond 800 pixels.

3. In **terminal.css**, set the minimum height of the paragraph to 200 pixels.

   After you’ve done this successfully, resize the browser and notice how the height of the paragraph’s box will no longer shrink below 200 pixels.

4. In **terminal.css**, set the maximum height of the paragraph to 300 pixels.

   After you’ve done this successfully, resize the browser and notice how the height of the paragraph’s box will no longer expand beyond 300 pixels. You should see your text overflowing. In the next exercise, we will fix that!
