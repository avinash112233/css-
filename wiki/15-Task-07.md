1. In **stylesheet.css**, add a class selector that will make the title of the page stand out more by making all of its letters uppercased. Write a class named `.uppercase`. Then, write this inside of its curly braces:

```css
text-transform: uppercase;
```

2. Now you can add the class to the title element. Navigate to **index.html**. On line 11, there is a `<h1>` element that has a class of `title`. Add the `uppercase` class to this element.
