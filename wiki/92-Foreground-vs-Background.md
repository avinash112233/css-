Before discussing the specifics of color, it’s important to make two distinctions about color. Color can affect the following design aspects:

1. The foreground color
2. The background color

Foreground color is the color that an element appears in. For example, when a heading is styled to appear green, the *foreground* color of the heading has been styled.

Conversely, when a heading is styled so that its background appears yellow, the background color of the heading has been styled

In CSS, these two design aspects can be styled with the following two properties:

1. `color` - this property styles an element’s foreground color.
2. `background-color` - this property styles an element’s background color.

```css
h1 {
  color: Red;
  background-color: Blue;
}
```

In the example above, the text of the heading will appear in red, and the background of the heading will appear blue.
