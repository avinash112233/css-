1. In the browser is a web page that uses named colors and hex colors. We’re going to translate the named colors into hex, to be more consistent. The colors won’t visually change, yet.

   In **coffee.css**, find the CSS rule that uses the named color `DarkSeaGreen` and change it to its hex value, `#8FBC8F`.

2. Find the four other named colors of the roast types and convert them to their hex values, as shown here:

```css
Sienna:       #A0522D
SaddleBrown:  #8B4513
Brown:        #A52A2A
Black:        #000000
```
