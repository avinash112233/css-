1. In **index.html**, the element on line 10 has an `h1` tag, two classes, and an ID. Since the ID is more specific than both, its styles will be applied to the element. Letâ€™s re-write the ID of this element to be less specific by creating classes.

   In **index.html**, delete the `id` attribute on the `h1` element on line 11.

2. Now delete the `#article-title` ID in the CSS.

   Navigate to **stylesheet.css** delete the `#article-id` ID selector and its contents.

3.Navigate to **stylesheet.css**. Add a class selector named `.cursive`. Inside its body, write:
```css
font-family: cursive;
```

4.Add another class selector named `.capitalize`. In its curly braces, write:
```css
text-transform: capitalize;
```

5. Now, navigate back to **index.html**, and replace the `uppercase` class with the `cursive` and `capitalize` classes on the `h1` element on line 11.
