1. In **stylesheet.css**, add a CSS selector for the HTML element with a class of `title`.

2. Inside the curly braces of the .title selector you just declared, write:

```css
color: teal;
```

   This code will change the color of the title to teal, since the title `h1` element has a class of `title` in the 
   HTML. You can see the HTML element by navigating to **index.html** on line 11.

   Weâ€™ll see in a later exercise why using `.title` overrides the `h1` selector.
