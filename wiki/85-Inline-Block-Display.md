The third value for the `display` property is `inline-block`. Inline-block display combines features of both inline and block elements. Inline-block elements can appear next to each other and we can specify their dimensions using the `width` and `height` properties. Images are the best example of default inline-block elements.

For example, `<div>`s in the CSS below will be displayed on the same line and with the specified dimensions:

```html
<div class="rectangle">
  <p>I’m a rectangle!</p>
</div>
<div class="rectangle">
  <p>So am I!</p>
</div>
<div class="rectangle">
  <p>Me three!</p>
</div>
```
```css
.rectangle {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 200px;
  height: 300px;
}
```

In the example above, there are three rectangular divs that each contain a paragraph of text. The `.rectangle` `<div>`s will all appear inline (provided there is enough space from left to right) with a width of 200 pixels and height of 300 pixels, even though the text inside of them may not require 200 pixels by 300 pixels of space.
