The hexadecimal and RGB color system can represent many more colors than the small set of CSS named colors. We can use this new set of colors to refine our web page’s style.

In both hex and decimal, we have three values, one for each color. Each can be one of 256 values. Specifically, `256 * 256 * 256 = 16,777,216`. That is the amount of colors we can now represent. Compare that to the 147 named CSS colors!

Recall that we started with named colors, converted them to hex, and then converted some of the hex colors to decimal. Unless we made a mistake, all of the colors should still be the same, visually. Let’s use our broadened palette to make some more refined color choices.
