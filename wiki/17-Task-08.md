1. In **stylesheet.css**, add a CSS selector for an element with an `id` of `article-title`. Inside of its curly braces, write:
```css
font-family: cursive;
text-transform: capitalize;
```
These two CSS attributes will make the font cursive and will capitalize the first letter of each word, while lowercasing the rest.

2. Navigate to **index.html**. On line 11, add an `id` attribute to the `h1` element, and include `article-title` as its `id`. Youâ€™ll see the title change to a cursive font that is not all uppercased.
