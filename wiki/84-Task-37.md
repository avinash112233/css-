1. In **survey.html**, add a `<footer>` element at the bottom of the document, right above the closing body tag.

2. Nothing changed! That’s because the `<footer>` element is empty. Add an `<h3>` element inside of the footer that says “Thanks for taking our survey!”

3. To improve the appearance of the web page, set the height of the footer to 100 pixels in **survey.css**.
