Every HTML element has a default `display` value that dictates if it can share horizontal space with other elements. Some elements fill the entire browser from left to right regardless of the size of their content. Other elements only take up as much horizontal space as their content requires and can be directly next to other elements.

In this lesson, weâ€™ll cover three values for the display property: `inline`, `block`, and `inline-block`.

The default `display` for some tags, such as `<em>`, `<strong>`, and `<a>`, is called *inline*. Inline elements have a box that wraps tightly around their content, only taking up the amount of space necessary to display their content and not requiring a new line after each element. The height and width of these elements cannot be specified in the CSS document. For example, the text of an anchor tag (`<a>`) will, by default, be displayed on the same line as the surrounding text, and it will only be as wide as necessary to contain its content. `inline` elements cannot be altered in size with the `height` or `width` CSS properties.

In the example above, the <em> element is inline, because it displays its content on the same line as the content surrounding it, including the anchor tag. This example will display:

The CSS `display` property provides the ability to make any element an inline element. This includes elements that are not inline by default such as paragraphs, divs, and headings.

```css
h1 {
  display: inline;
}
```

The CSS in the example above will change the display of all `<h1>` elements to `inline`. The browser will render `<h1>` elements on the same line as other inline elements immediately before or after them (if there are any).
