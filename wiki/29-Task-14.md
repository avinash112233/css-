1. Add `!important` to the `h5` selector’s `color` attribute that you defined in the last exercise. `!important` should go after `rebeccapurple`, and before the semicolon.

   Notice that the `h5` elements will now be `rebeccapurple` instead of `teal`. That’s because `!important` will override any other style no matter what.
